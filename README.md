# Social-context-feature
This code repository is dedicated to our new multi-label iterative relational neighbor classifier that employs social context features (SCRN). Our classifier incorporates a class propagation probability distribution obtained from instances’ social features, which are in turn extracted from the network topology. This class-propagation probability captures the node’s intrinsic likelihood of belonging to each class, and serves as a prior weight for each class when aggregating the neighbors’ class labels in the collective inference procedure. A relaxation labeling approach is used for the collective inference framework.
